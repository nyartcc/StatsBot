## Count Members
This script counts members, visitors and LOA members and publish them to Slack once per week.

## Weekly Hours
A once-per-week script that sums the hours publishing it to a separate table as well as slack.

## Montly Hours
This once a month script does a bunch of things, but the point is to save the monthly hours for the entire artcc into a separate table for easy data collection if needed. Also alerts to Slack if data has changed for some reason.
